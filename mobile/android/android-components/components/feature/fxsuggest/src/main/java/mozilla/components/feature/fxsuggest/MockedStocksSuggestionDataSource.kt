/**
 * Mock implementation of [AwesomeBar.StocksSuggestionDataSource].
 *
 * This data source returns a static list of predefined stock suggestions and is intended
 * strictly for development, visual testing, and UI prototyping.
 *
 * It does not perform any network requests and does not simulate latency.
 * If realistic behaviour (e.g. delayed responses, cancellation, overlapping requests)
 * is required for testing asynchronous flows, consider adding an artificial delay
 * inside [fetch] or using a test-specific implementation.
 *
 * This implementation should not be used in production builds.
